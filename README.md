# Zero Title Bar

This is fork based on the @lexicalunit [no-title-bar](https://atom.io/packages/no-title-bar) plugin.

> **NOTE:** Limited to systems that support Custom Title Bar, meaning Mac OS.

Hides the Atom title bar on systems that support it. Make sure to enable **Use Custom Title Bar** in your **Core** Atom settings (`core.useCustomTitleBar: true` in your `config.cson`). This setting was first available in Atom Beta version 1.11.0.
